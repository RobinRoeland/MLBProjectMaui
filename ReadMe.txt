BaseballCalcASP-Localisers is the API, it has been changed and extended to work with maui and our features. Always make sure this is running!

BaseballScoringApp is the maui side of the project, here you will find the frontend for this project.
In the Globals.cs file, you will find different IP settings for startup. This includes information which one to use when. Make sure when you use your phone to update the IP on the second line!

When starting the project there will be no data yet, go to the Test page after login. Firstly click the ImportTeamsFromMLB button and wait for the popup, after the popup do the same for the ImportRosterForMLB, this second one can take some time.
